# Understanding Project Management in Node.js

## a. Package Managers

### What is a package manager?

A package manager is a tool that helps developers install, update, remove, and manage external libraries (packages) required in a project. Instead of writing everything from scratch, developers can reuse existing code written by others.

**Example:**
If you want to use a library to handle HTTP requests, you can install it using a package manager rather than writing all the logic yourself.

### Why do we need package managers in backend development?

In backend development, applications depend on many libraries for tasks such as routing, database connectivity, authentication, and logging. Package managers:

* Save development time
* Ensure consistency across development environments
* Manage versions of dependencies
* Automatically resolve dependency relationships

### Problems faced if package managers are not used

If package managers are not used:

* Developers must manually download and manage libraries
* Version conflicts become common
* Project setup becomes time-consuming
* Collaboration becomes difficult due to inconsistent dependencies

## b. NPM (Node Package Manager)

### What is NPM?

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install and manage JavaScript libraries and tools required for Node.js applications. NPM comes bundled with Node.js.

### Why is NPM important for Node.js applications?

NPM is important because:

* It provides access to a large ecosystem of open-source packages
* It simplifies dependency management
* It helps in running project-related scripts
* It ensures faster and standardized development

### How NPM helps in managing dependencies

NPM keeps track of project dependencies in the `package.json` file. When a dependency is installed:

* It is added to `package.json`
* The exact installed version is recorded in `package-lock.json`
* The package is downloaded into the `node_modules` folder

**Example:**

```bash
npm install express
```

This installs Express and records it as a dependency.

## c. Backend Project Initialization

### What is the command used to initialize a backend (Node.js) project?

The command used is:

```bash
npm init
```

### Explain what `npm init` and `npm init -y` do

* `npm init`:

  * Starts an interactive process
  * Asks questions like project name, version, description, entry file, etc.
  * Creates a `package.json` file based on the inputs

* `npm init -y`:

  * Skips all questions
  * Uses default values
  * Quickly creates a `package.json` file

## d. Files and Folders Created After Project Initialization

### package.json

* Contains project metadata (name, version, description)
* Lists dependencies and scripts
* Acts as the core configuration file for the project

### node_modules

* Contains all installed dependencies
* Automatically generated by NPM
* Can be recreated using `npm install`

### package-lock.json

* Records exact versions of installed dependencies
* Ensures the same dependency tree across all environments
* Improves consistency and reliability
